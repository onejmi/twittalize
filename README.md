# Twittalize ðŸ§ª- Follow filter to save precious time!

Currently does **not** do advanced follow-back analysis. Works off of ```following:follower``` ratio. 

Results are saved in ```results.json```

Remember to install the dependencies before starting: ```npm install```

## Configuration âš™
Create a ```keys.js``` with this template:
```javascript
module.exports = { 
    user: 'TWITTER_USERNAME', 
    password: 'TWITTER_PASSWORD',
    agent: 'USER_AGENT'
}
```
